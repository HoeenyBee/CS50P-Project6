## Description
This is my sixth Python project from the CS50P course. The program prompts the user for an input and then depending on the answer, it can print either Yes or No.
> here is the task copied from the course:
> "In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No."

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved the speed of creating simple projects
- Practiced using conditional statements (if, elif, else) and logical operators (and, or)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `deep.py`. For example:
```bash
cd name-of-repo-folder
python deep.py
```

## Type your input. For a "Yes" answer it must be: `42`, `forty-two`, `forty two`. For a "No" answer it can be anything else.
